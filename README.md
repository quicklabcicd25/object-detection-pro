## Object Detection on Video using TensorFlow & PyTorch
This project demonstrates real-time object detection on a video file using both TensorFlow Hub and PyTorch torchvision models. It uses pre-trained deep learning models to identify and draw bounding boxes around objects in a video

🚀 Features:
✅ Detects multiple objects per frame in a video

✅ Draws bounding boxes with class labels and confidence scores

✅ Applies Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to remove overlapping boxes

✅ Supports both TensorFlow (using TF Hub) and PyTorch (using torchvision)

✅ Randomly assigns consistent colors for each detected class

🛠️ #Technologies Used:
Python

TensorFlow (TF Hub)

NumPy
🧠# Models Used:
TensorFlow: Custom model loaded via hub.load()

PyTorch: Pretrained Faster R-CNN ResNet50 FPN from torchvision.models.detection
